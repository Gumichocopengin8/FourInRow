# Four In Row

## Description
I made it for CS305.

Actually, I made Air Runner for the project because it's much more fun to create and play, but I was rejected to create it.

That is why I made this boring game for the project.

If you are interested in Air Runner, it is on GitHub repository. It's still boring, but better than this.
